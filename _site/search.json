Not just analytics, but the curation, storage, and sharing of data. How it’s referred to, how it’s communicated, and how it impacts people.\nThis site serves as my website for networking and a home for my blog; I want to develop my skills as an information professional and I want to chronicle that journey for others to see.\nI’m most active on Mastodon where I follow a lot of GLAM, open source, privacy, and digital humanities folks."
