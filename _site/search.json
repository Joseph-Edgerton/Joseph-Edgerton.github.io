If you have stuff to get rid of, or in turn need stuff, it’s great. However, being in the middle just makes it another scroll-haven that’s hard to turn away from."

This was a fairly quick response. The first annoyance then came from believing I had to use my Chrome browser because Snapchat for Web only supports Chromium browsers (“Snapchat for Web only supports the latest version of Chrome, Edge, and Safari on computers”). In reality, I could just access my Snap account on their account.snapchat.com site.\nAfter getting the email I logged into my account through my laptop, downloaded the zip file, and I spent the next hour reviewing a bunch of old files.
