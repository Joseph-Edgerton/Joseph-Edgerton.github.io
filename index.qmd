# Hi, I'm Joe Edgerton.

I'm a Research Data Management Librarian. I'm a self-taught R person and I love learning about data. Not just analytics, but the curation, storage, and sharing of data. How it's referred to, how it's communicated, and how it impacts people.

This site serves as my website for networking and a home for my blog; I want to develop my skills as an information professional and I want to chronicle that journey for others to see.

I'm most active on [Mastodon](https://glammr.us/@JosephEdgerton) where I follow a lot of GLAM, open source, privacy, and digital humanities folks.
